# Application-specific evaluation

Some applications use their own evaluation protocols, including specialized metrics, and their benchmarking code typically restricts the models that can be evaluated. To address this limitation and enable evaluation code to work with models available on EVAR (with wrapper implementations), we modify these applications to support a broader range of models. This subproject outlines the precise steps and codes required to integrate EVAR into each application.
